--ArrayList vs LinkedList
-ArrayList
1) ArrayList memory ke andar implement hota hai dynamic array ki help se
2) Insert: O(n)
3) Search: O(1)

-LinkedList
1) ke andar memory jo allocated hoti hai vo hoti hai non-contiguous
2) Insert: O(1)
3) Search: O(n)
4) Variable size
5) non-contiguous memory

--LinkedList
- banta hai basic structure se jise hum kehte hai node
- head = first node
- tail = last node
- types: -> Singular
         -> Double
         -> Circular

--Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (Floyd’s Cycle Finding Algorithm):
    - Hare-Tortoise algorithm is a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers,
  moving through the sequence at different speeds. This algorithm is used to
  find a loop in a linked list. It uses two pointers one moving twice as fast as
  the other one. The faster one is called the fast pointer and the other one is called the slow pointer.
    - How Does Floyd’s Cycle Finding Algorithm Works?
        -> While traversing the linked list one of these things will occur-
                1) The Fast pointer may reach the end (NULL) this shows that there is no loop in the linked list.
                2) The Fast pointer again catches the slow pointer at some time therefore a loop exists in the linked list.
