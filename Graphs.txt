GRAPHS:

- Network of Nodes
    - Nodes = Vertex (plural: vertices)
    - Connection between Nodes = Edge
- Algos
    - Shortest Path

- Basic of GRAPHS
    -> Edge Direction
        > Uni-directional
        > Bi-directional / Undirectional
    -> Edge Weight
        > Weighted
        > Un-Weighted

- Storing a Graph
    > Adjacency List (most common and efficient)
    > Adjacency Matrix
    > Edge List
    >  2D Matrix (Implicit Graph)

        -> Adjacency List (List of Lists) :-
               
- Graph Traversals
    > Breadth First Search (BFS)

    > Depth First Search (DFS)
